# Official Cortexerr Api Types #
These are the full types both used internally and for the public Api. Types should be valid with full tsdocs explaining detailed behavior.

Hopefully this is stable enough if not I will rewrite it ideally given this is not mission critical its only goal is merging tsdocs with typescripts 
generated type declaration files it should be good enough. Always can revert to non tsdoc version of real type files worse case.
