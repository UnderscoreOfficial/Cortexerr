Ok pnpm run build, will run the tsc building of the .d.ts type declarations
  on app, core, partial, and additive. 

it then uses its merge.ts script to merge typedocs within the docs folder
  with types its able to find existing in dist.

final types with any merged tsdocs will be in merged, any docs it could not
  merge will be in not-transfered (likely changed names or old docs).


for changes ran here to be reflected back in the core app the build, merge
  must becalled and pnpm install ran at the app.
